		Proficient frontend developer with 7 years of experience specializing in user interface for

	<SectionParagraph>
		I had the pleasure of working with various frontend frameworks and libraries such as AngularJS,
		Svelte and React to build powerful, efficient, and quality web applications. I like to focus on
		the user interface above all else, but I do enjoy the occasional backend implementations or
		internal tools development to improve the development lifecycle.
